# Introduction
This repository is a simple attempt to make some art with Processing. The pde file contains some code
for making particles follow a path to the surface of a shape.

You can left click to cycle through some shapes, and right click to change how the shapes are used. The options
are that the particles choose a place randomly, non-randomly, or non-randomly and without user intervention.


There will be github release for compiled versions for Windows which should be working executables in case you want to 
play around with this piece.


Thank you!
